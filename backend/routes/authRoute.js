/*
 When you are working in a REST API:
 
  Name your endpoints in kebab-case
   â€“ it's more readable in URLs and widely accepted in REST conventions.
    eg: /sign-up instead of /signUp or /signup

  Keep all endpoint paths in lowercase to avoid case sensitivity issues across different environments.

  Use clear and descriptive names that indicate the action or resource:
  and they should name with the verb not action like below instead of /sign-in-user x that means
  Avoid using verbs in the URL path -> HTTP methods already imply the action:
    - Prefer: POST /sign-in -> correct
    - Avoid: POST /doSignIn -> wrong
